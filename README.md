# SolarGuardPro

For Praxis III, our second-year engineering design course project, we developed a solar panel protection and cleaning solution to improve the efficiency of solar panel energy generation for residential buildings by addressing implementation issues related to West African weather conditions.

A 3D Printed + laser cut CAD design was built for our prototype's chassis, along with an electrical subsystem and code architecture involving an Arduino Mega, colour sensors, photoresistors and a stepper motor.

The prototype detects when dust accumulation hinders the performance of the solar panel which it holds, and at that point, begins to autonomously rotate around the panel and clear all dust.

Key Performance Stats:
-  PCT transmits 94.1% of
sunlight!

- Motors rotates full 360Â° with
90% success
  
- Dust maintained below
constraint of 0.224 mg/cm2
